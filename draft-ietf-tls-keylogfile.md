--- abstract

A format that supports the logging information about the secrets used in a TLS
connection is described.  Recording secrets to a file in SSLKEYLOGFILE format
allows diagnostic and logging tools that use this file to decrypt messages
exchanged by TLS endpoints.

# Introduction

Debugging or analyzing protocols can be challenging when TLS {{?TLS13}} is used
to protect the content of communications.  Inspecting the content of encrypted
messages in diagnostic tools can enable more thorough analysis.

Over time, multiple TLS implementations have informally adopted a file format
that logging the secret values generated by the TLS key schedule.  In many
implementations, the file that the secrets are logged to is specified in an
environment variable named "SSLKEYLOGFILE", hence the name of SSLKEYLOGFILE
format.  Note the use of "SSL" as this convention originally predates the
adoption of TLS as the name of the protocol.

This document describes the SSLKEYLOGFILE format.  This format can be used for
TLS 1.2 {{!TLS12=RFC5246}} and TLS 1.3 {{!TLS13=RFC8446}}.  The format also
supports earlier TLS versions, though use of earlier versions is forbidden
{{?RFC8996}}.  This format can also be used with DTLS {{?DTLS13=RFC9147}}, QUIC
{{?RFC9000}}{{?RFC9001}}, and other protocols that also use the TLS key
schedule.  Use of this format could complement other protocol-specific logging
such as QLOG {{?QLOG=I-D.ietf-quic-qlog-main-schema}}.


## Applicability Statement

The artifact that this document describes - if made available to entities other
than endpoints - completely undermines the core guarantees that TLS provides.
This format is intended for use in systems where TLS only protects test data.
While the access that this information provides to TLS connections can be useful
for diagnosing problems while developing systems, this mechanism MUST NOT be
used in a production system.


## Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


# The SSLKEYLOGFILE Format

A file in SSLKEYLOGFILE format is a text file.  This document specifies the
character encoding as UTF-8 {{!RFC3629}}.  Though the format itself only
includes ASCII characters {{?RFC0020}}, comments MAY contain other characters.
Though Unicode is permitted in comments, the file MUST NOT contain a Unicode
byte order mark (U+FEFF).

Lines are terminated using the line ending convention of the platform on which
the file is generated.  Tools that process these files MUST accept CRLF (U+13
followed by U+10), CR (U+13), or LF (U+10) as a line terminator.  Lines are
ignored if they are empty or if the first character is an octothorp character
('#', U+23).  Other lines of the file each contain a single secret.

Implementations that record secrets to a file do so continuously as those
secrets are generated.

Each secret is described using a single line composed of three values that are
separated by a single space character (U+20).  These values are:

label:

: The label identifies the type of secret that is being conveyed; see {{labels}}
  for a description of the labels that are defined in this document.

client_random:

: The 32-byte value of the Random field from the ClientHello message that
  established the TLS connection.  This value is encoded as 64 hexadecimal
  characters.  Including this field allows a single file to include secrets from
  multiple connections and for the secrets to be applied to the correct
  connection, though this depends on being able to match records to the correct
  ClientHello message.

secret:

: The value of the identified secret for the identified connection.  This value
  is encoded in hexadecimal, with a length that depends on the size of the
  secret.

For the hexadecimal values of the `client_random` or `secret`, no convention
exists for the case of characters 'a' through 'f' (or 'A' through 'F').  Files
can be generated with either, so either form MUST be accepted when processing a
file.

Diagnostic tools that accept files in this format might choose to ignore lines
that do not conform to this format in the interest of ensuring that secrets can
be obtained from corrupted files.

Logged secret values are not annotated with the cipher suite or other connection
parameters.  A record of the TLS handshake might therefore be needed to use the
logged secrets.


## Secret Labels for TLS 1.3 {#labels}

An implementation of TLS 1.3 produces a number of values as part of the key
schedule (see {{Section 7.1 of !TLS13}}).  Each of the following labels
correspond to the equivalent secret produced by the key schedule:

CLIENT_EARLY_TRAFFIC_SECRET:

: This secret is used to protect records sent by the client as early data, if
  early data is attempted by the client.  Note that a server that rejects early
  data will not log this secret, though a client that attempts early data can do
  so unconditionally.

EARLY_EXPORTER_MASTER_SECRET:

: This secret is used for early exporters.  Like the
  CLIENT_EARLY_TRAFFIC_SECRET, this is only generated when early data is
  attempted and might not be logged by a server if early data is rejected.

CLIENT_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET:

: This secret is used to protect handshake records sent by the client.

SERVER_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET:

: This secret is used to protect handshake records sent by the server.

CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0:

: This secret is used to protect application_data records sent by the client
  immediately after the handshake completes.  This secret is identified as
  `client_application_traffic_secret_0` in the TLS 1.3 key schedule.

SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0:

: This secret is used to protect application_data records sent by the server
  immediately after the handshake completes.  This secret is identified as
  `server_application_traffic_secret_0` in the TLS 1.3 key schedule.

EXPORTER_SECRET:

: This secret is used in generating exporters {{Section 7.5 of !TLS13}}.
{: newline="true"}

These labels all appear in uppercase in the key log, but they correspond to
lowercase labels in the TLS key schedule ({{Section 7.1 of !TLS13}}), except for
the application data secrets as noted.  For example, "EXPORTER_SECRET" in the
log file corresponds to the secret named `exporter_secret`.

Note that the order that labels appear here corresponds to the order in which
they are presented in {{?TLS13}}, but there is no guarantee that implementations
will log secrets strictly in this order.

Key updates ({{Section 7.2 of !TLS13}}) result in new secrets being generated
for protecting `application_data` records.  The label used for these secrets
comprises a base label of "CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_" for a client or
"SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_" for a server, plus the decimal value of a counter.
This counter identifies the number of key updates that occurred to produce this
secret.  This counter starts at 0, which produces the first application data
traffic secret, as above. Note that with knowledge of "_TRAFFIC_SECRET_N",
all subsequent application data traffic secret can be derived without any
additional information.

## Secret Labels for TLS 1.2

An implementation of TLS 1.2 {{!TLS12}} (and also earlier versions) use the
label "CLIENT_RANDOM" to identify the "master" secret for the connection.


# Security Considerations {#security}

Access to the content of a file in SSLKEYLOGFILE format allows an attacker to
break the confidentiality protection on any TLS connections that are included in
the file.  This includes both active connections and connections for which
encrypted records were previously stored.  Ensuring adequate access control on
these files therefore becomes very important.

Implementations that support logging this data need to ensure that logging can
only be enabled by those who are authorized.  Allowing logging to be initiated
by any entity that is not otherwise authorized to observe or modify the content
of connections for which secrets are logged could represent a privilege
escalation attack.  Implementations that enable logging also need to ensure that
access to logged secrets is limited, using appropriate file permissions or
equivalent access control mechanisms.

In order to support decryption, the secrets necessary to remove record
protection are logged.  However, as the keys that can be derived from these
secrets are symmetric, an adversary with access to these secrets is also able to
encrypt data for an active connection.  This might allow for injection or
modification of application data on a connection that would otherwise be
protected by TLS.

As some protocols rely on TLS for generating encryption keys, the SSLKEYLOGFILE
format includes keys that identify the secret used in TLS exporters or early
exporters ({{Section 7.5 of ?TLS13}}.  Knowledge of these secrets can enable
more than inspection or modification of encrypted data, depending on how an
application protocol uses exporters.  For instance, exporters might be used for
session bindings (e.g., {{?RFC8471}}), authentication (e.g., {{?RFC9261}}), or
other derived secrets that are used in application context.  An adversary that
obtains these secrets might be able to use this information to attack these
applications.  A TLS implementation might either choose to omit these secrets in
contexts where the information might be abused or require separate
authorization to enable logging of exporter secrets.

Using an environment variable, such as `SSLKEYLOGFILE`, to enable logging
implies that access to the launch context for the application is needed to
authorize logging.  On systems that support specially-named files, logs might be
directed to these names so that logging does not result in storage, but enable
consumption by other programs.  In both cases, applications might require
special authorization or they might rely on system-level access control to limit
access to these capabilities.

Forward secrecy guarantees provided in TLS 1.3 (see {{Section 1.2 and Appendix
E.1 of ?RFC8446}}) and some modes of TLS 1.2 (such as those in {{Sections 2.2
and 2.4 of ?RFC4492}}) do not hold if keys are saved.  Logged keys
therefore risk the authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity of any data that
is exchanged.

Logging the TLS 1.2 "master" secret provides the recipient of that secret far
greater access to an active connection than TLS 1.3 secrets.  In addition to
reading and altering protected messages, the TLS 1.2 "master" secret confers the
ability to resume the connection and impersonate either endpoint, insert records
that result in renegotiation, and forge Finished messages.  Implementations can
avoid the risks associated with these capabilities by not logging this secret
value.

The SSLKEYLOGFILE format originated in the NSS project, but it has evolved over
time as TLS has changed.  Many people contributed to this evolution.  The author
is only documenting the format as it is used.
